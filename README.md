## Project Overview

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away, and things aren't looking good. The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Identify Passengers Affected by the Anomaly**: Develop a machine learning model that predicts which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension due to the spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud.

2. **Optimize Rescue Efforts**: By accurately identifying affected passengers, assist rescue crews in focusing their efforts on retrieving the lost passengers and ensuring their safe return.

3. **Provide Insights**: Gain insights into the characteristics of passengers who were affected by the anomaly. Understand if certain demographics or factors played a role in their transportation.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was obtained from [source_name](link_to_source). It contains information about the passengers on Spaceship Titanic, including their personal details, ticket information, and fate after the collision.

## Data Preprocessing

Before modeling, the data underwent several preprocessing steps, including:

- Handling missing values.
- Feature engineering to create relevant features.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our exploratory data analysis revealed key insights:

- Distribution of passengers' age, gender, and class.
- Correlations between passenger attributes and the likelihood of being affected by the anomaly.

## Machine Learning Models

To predict passengers affected by the anomaly, we implemented the following machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- KNN
- Bagging Classifier

These models were chosen based on their performance and suitability for binary classification tasks.

## Results

Our models achieved the following results on the test dataset:

- Logistic Regression Accuracy of 72%
- Random Forest Classifier Accuracy of 78%
- Decision Tree Accuracy of 67%
- SVM Accuracy of 74%
- KNN Accuracy of 71%
- Bagging Classifier Accuracy of 73%

Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models and was selected for further analysis.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a predictive model to identify passengers transported to an alternate dimension following the collision of Spaceship Titanic with a spacetime anomaly. This information can aid rescue efforts and provide insights into the cosmic mystery surrounding the anomaly.

## Future Work

Future work on this project may include:

- Fine-tuning the selected model for even higher accuracy.
- Gathering additional data to enhance prediction capabilities.
- Expanding the analysis to understand the temporal and spatial aspects of the anomaly.
